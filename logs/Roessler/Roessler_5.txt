t_max = 30.0, t_min = 1.0
ε = 0.01, δ = 0.5

Initial states are
u[1] = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
u[2] = [-1.0, -1.31596, -1.354461]
u[3] = [0.0, -0.25, 0.42081]

Poincare surface of sections defined by:
 - Direction of movement along the axis x
 - Value in that direction is 0.1256000895371827
 - Direction of plane intersection comes with decreasing coordinates (towards the negative normal)
